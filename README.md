# celo-airdrop
A boilerplate guide to deploying an erc-20 token airdrop on Celo. 
This tutorial was inspired by Uniswaps's [Merkle Distributor](https://github.com/Uniswap/merkle-distributor).

## You will 

- Deploy an Airdrop contract to Alfajores (Celo's testnet)
- Fund the contract using the [Alfajores faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet)
- Claim the erc20 tokens using the [web3 sdk](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.3/)


## Pre-requisites
1. Truffle v5.5.10 installed [npm install -g truffle@5.5.10](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation/)
2. Basic understanding of nodejs
3. Clone this repository & install dependencies

## How airdropping tokens with an erc20 contract works
The high-level purpose of an airdrop is to allow a pre-configured set of users to claim tokens based on some historical data. 

In this tutorial, we will deploy an Airdrop contract on Celo's testnet that requires two parameters upon creation;

1. The erc-20 token contract address (you can find this on [blockscout](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/))
2. The Merkle root of the tree containing the whitelisted users & the corresponding amounts. 

In the context of this tutorial, using a Merkle tree allows us to verify a user is eligible for the airdrop without having to maintain that data on chain, thus saving computational resources. By only storing the root of the merkle tree on chain, we can verify a specified user is eligible given the request is accompanied by additional data e.g. amount eligible, related proofs and index in the tree. You can learn more about Merkle trees [here](https://brilliant.org/wiki/merkle-tree/).



## Step 1 of 6

Fund your Celo address using the [Alfajores faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) (to generate a new key pair, run *node tutorial/createAccount.js* from the root directory)

Afterwords create the **.env** file by running the following command;

    ```
        cp .env.example .env
    ```

Finally, paste your address and private key as the corresponding key values in the **.env** file.

## Step 2 of 6

Let's add a json file to the project containing an array of addresses that are eligible for the Airdrop.

This list should contain a simple mapping of addresses and token values defined in WEI. 

For the sake of this tutorial, there is an example eligibility list under the *tutorial* directory which you can use. If you decide to use the provided example list, nothing else needs to be done and you can move to the next step otherwise, be sure the json file you add is in the same format.
  
## Step 3 of 6

Let's generate the file containing the Merkle root and corresponding proofs of which will be required to create the contract and claim the tokens.

Under the scrips/merkle-tree directory there is a file called *generate-merkle-root.ts*. We can execute this script by passing in the path to the eligibility-list specified in the previous step. 

After the script executes successfully, another file called *generated-merkle-root.json* will be created in the root directory which contains details such as the merkle root, eligible addresses,and respective proofs, etc.

Here's the command to execute (from the root directory) using the path to the example eligibility list;

```
    ts-node scripts/merkle-tree/generate-merkle-root.ts -i tutorial/example-eligibility-list.json
```

## Step 4 of 6

Now let's work on the [migration](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations/) file that truffle will use to deploy the airdrop contract. 

For the sake of this tutorial, I have already created the migration file called *2_deploy_airdrop.js* under the *migrations* directory. All that's left to do is fill in the values. 

> At this point, if you have not looked at the *Airdrop.sol* file under the *contracts* directory, now would be a good time to do so. Notice the constructor requires two parameters; the erc20 token address and the merkle root. These are immutable parameters that are set when the contract is created.

Okay, now open the file **2_deploy_airdrop.js** under the **migrations** directory. Inside the functions definition is a call to the Deployer.deploy method which is the Truffle wrapper for deploying contracts to the specified network. 

> When creating this tutorial, I used the Celo token address on Alfajores, but you can use any other erc20 token if you'd like. Just know that the contract will have to be funded with that token.

Set the first param to the token address and the second param to the merkle root (get this from the file we generated in step 2 *generated-merkle-root.json*).

The file should look similar to this;

```
var Airdrop = artifacts.require("Airdrop");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(
    Airdrop,
    "0xF194afDf50B03e69Bd7D057c1Aa9e10c9954E4C9",
    "0x7ecb997833ad5774cf633610d0fab6ba8cc826f1e910596b2c3943899fadcdef"
  );
};

```


## Step 5 of 6

In this step we will deploy the Airdrop contract.

Make sure there is sufficient $celo belonging to the address key you pasted in the .env file in step 1 -> we need it to pay for gas. 

Run the following command from the root directory to deploy the Airdrop contract to Alfajores.

```
    truffle migrate --network alfajores
```

The output should look similar to the following

(Don't clear your terminal ðŸ‘€)

## Step 6 of 7

At this point we have;

1. Created a Merkle tree with addresses and corresponding values
2. Deployed an Airdrop contract to Alfajores with the corresponding merkle root and token address

Next, we need to fund the contract

Get the contract address from the output of the command you ran in step 4

> In the above example, that would be 0x23047531b51eE8Cb044AF18B87365B9De1DF5aF7

If you are using a token other than Celo or one of it's stable coins, you'll need to send a sufficient amount to that address to accommodate for this airdrop. Otherwise, head back over to the [Alfajores faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) and fund the contract address.

Make sure to confirm the contract address has the funds by visiting the [blockscout](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/)

## Step 7 of 7

Now for the fun part ðŸ˜Ž

To claim for every address specified in the eligibility list, run the following command with the path to the *generate-merkle-root.ts* file

```
 ts-node scripts/contract-interaction/claim-airdrop.ts -i generated-merkle-root.json
```

To claim for only one specified address, just add the **-a** flag followed by the address e.g.

```
 ts-node scripts/contract-interaction/claim-airdrop.ts -i generated-merkle-root.json -a 0x0659f79530111c8b584af5EF499c4AfeD79a04DF
```

You can now navigate to [blockscout](https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/), paste the address you claimed the tokens for, and see the transaction which claimed the tokens!

## Summary
In this tutorial, we went over what it takes to deploy and claim an airdrop on Celo at a very high level.

Although, for a production grade environment, there are some things we should alter/add. For example, the design & implementation of a token refund function that can be invoked by the contract owner. Teams typically implement an automatic refund of unclaimed tokens after some epoch to avoid unnecessary loss. 

Further, users typically prefer a nice user interface opposed to running scripts via terminal; this means constructing the transaction for the user if they are eligible for the airdrop. 

Finally, there are countless possibilities to go about airdropping tokens, this is merely an example of one. If you have any feedback please share! I hope you enjoyed!
